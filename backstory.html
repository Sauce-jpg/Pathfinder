  <h1>Character Backstory</h1>
  <h2>Vaelin Duskryn, Last Scion of House Duskryn</h2>
  <p><strong>Race:</strong> Drow (Noble)</p>
  <p><strong>Class:</strong> Wizard (Necromancer Aspirant)</p>
  <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> (Your choice—likely Neutral Evil, Lawful Evil, or Neutral)</p>
  <p><strong>Age:</strong> 120 (Young Adult by Drow standards)</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Fall of House Duskryn</h2>
    <p>Deep within the subterranean metropolis of Zirith-Mor, where the dark elves’ rule with cunning and cruelty, the noble House Duskryn was once a name spoken with reverence and fear. Known for its arcane prowess and mastery over death magic, the Duskryn lineage traced its power back to an ancient pact with a forgotten deity of undeath. It was said that no Duskryn ever truly perished—their spirits lingered, bound in servitude beyond the grave.
Vaelin was born into this legacy, the youngest scion of House Duskryn, raised among silken decadence and arcane tutelage. As the third son, he was never destined to rule, but his natural talent for magic and his keen intellect made him a favored student among the House's necromancers. His mother, Matron Yzidora Duskryn, saw great potential in him—perhaps even enough to challenge the eldest heir for dominance one day.
But power breeds enemies.
A rival house, House Vhaelor, conspired against the Duskryn. They wove a web of lies, accused the Duskryn of heresy against the Spider Queen, and forged alliances with powerful priestesses who declared House Duskryn anathema. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Night of the Blood Moon</h2>
    <p>One fateful night, during a rare celestial event known as the Blood Moon Eclipse, the Duskryn estate was attacked. A coalition of rival drow houses, fearful of your family’s growing influence, launched a devastating coup, allying with a powerful surface-dwelling necromancer who coveted the Duskryn family’s secrets.
Your mother, Matron Yzidora, fought with unparalleled ferocity, her magic shattering attackers with waves of necrotic energy. Your elder siblings—Ryzan, the duelist, and Veylin, the battle-mage—held the line. But treachery came from within.
One of your own blood, Uncle Xalith Duskryn, turned against the family. He had been promised power and a place among the victors in exchange for betraying the house’s defences. Your family was slaughtered. The once-proud halls of House Duskryn were left in ruin, its grand library of necromantic lore plundered, its members slain by your enemies. The halls of Duskryn ran red with blood.
Vaelin barely escaped. He was forced to watch, hidden beneath the corpses of his own kin, as his mother was impaled upon a cursed spear and his siblings were torn apart by magic. He felt his father’s blood pool around him, and for the first time in his life, he knew helplessness.
But helplessness was fleeting. Hatred, however, was eternal.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Buried Truth</h2>
    <p>As Vaelin fled the ruins of his house, he found himself haunted—not just by memories, but by the faint whispers of his ancestors. House Duskryn had long experimented with the boundaries between life and death, and even in their demise, their spirits lingered. Whether this was a curse, a blessing, or something else entirely, Vaelin did not yet understand. But he knew one thing: he was not alone.
His escape was not a clean one. He was pursued—first by bounty hunters sent by House Vhaelor, and then by things far worse. The priestesses of the Spider Queen do not forgive heretics, and whispers of a surviving Duskryn would not be ignored. To escape the Underdark, Vaelin had to outthink his hunters, use what magic he could muster, and bargain with creatures he barely understood. Eventually, he reached the surface, a world that stung his eyes and chilled his bones. But the surface world was a fresh slate. Here, he could grow. Here, he could make the Vhaelor suffer.
But he is not the only one who remembers the past.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Road to Power</h2>
    <p>Now, at the beginning of his journey, he is weak. A mere shadow of what he will become. Vaelin’s path is uncertain, but one thing is clear: he will not let his family’s legacy be forgotten. He has a purpose—to reclaim his House’s lost power, to master necromancy, and to raise his family from the grave as an unstoppable force of undeath.
 House Vhaelor will suffer. Their souls will know torment. Their bloodlines will end. The world will know the name Duskryn once more. And this time, it will tremble. 
For the dead do not forget.</p>
